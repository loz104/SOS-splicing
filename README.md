## Scripts

- **`SOS_splicing_coverage.R`**  
  Generates coverage plots of SOS splicing events using long-read Nanopore sequencing data.

- **`Spliceosomal_ss_analyses.R`**  
  Extracts 10,000 randomly selected *C. elegans* introns for spliceosomal splice site analysis.

- **`SOS_splicing_isoform.R`**  
  Summarizes SOS splicing events identified by IsoQuant from Nanopore data.

- **`RIP_seq_targets.R`**  
  Produces scatterplots of enriched targets from RIP-seq experiments.

- **`WGS_mapping_plot.R`**  
  Visualizes the genomic distribution of SOS splicing-related mutations detected by whole-genome sequencing.

- **`PSI_analyses.R`**  
  Generates box plots of alternative splicing events analyzed using rMATS.

## System Requirements

All scripts were run using **R version 4.4.2**.  
Required R packages are listed at the beginning of each script.
